/**
 * GetPaymentSequenceType - **Only relevant for recurring payments.**
 * 
 * Indicate which part of a recurring sequence this payment is for.
 * 
 * Recurring payments can only take place if a mandate is available. A common way to establish such a mandate is
 * through a `first` payment. With a `first` payment, the customer agrees to automatic recurring charges taking place
 * on their account in the future.
 * 
 * If set to `recurring`, the customer's card is charged automatically.
 * 
 * Defaults to `oneoff`, which is a regular non-recurring payment.
 * 
 * For PayPal payments, recurring is only possible if your connected PayPal account allows it. You can call our
 * [Methods API](list-methods) with parameter `sequenceType: first` to discover which payment methods on your account
 * are set up correctly for recurring payments.
